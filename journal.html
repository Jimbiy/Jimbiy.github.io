<h3>Functions:</h3>
		<p>A function is an action you can put things inside of it. When you "call it" or "run it" does the things.
			<br><br>
		When we want to run a function on the whole document we say document.___... when we want to do this with a div we say it's id then it's style and then the atribute to change - we usually put these things inside themsleves (e.g.box.style.opacity = "0")
<br><br>
		addEventListener("click", function(){})
<br><br>
		setInterval ()// makes a function run every time based on a interval that you set//
<br><br>
		createElement()//makes a div or link or whatever you ask it to make//
<br><br>
		classList.add()//adds a class to a element we've created//
<br><br>
		console.log()// puts something in the consol//
<br><br>
		alert()//makes the tab put out an alert//
<br><br>
		play()// plays an audio file - use audio file id//
		pause()// pause an audio file - use audio file id//
